 * Description:			This class serves to play an actual game of poker. The essential features of this class is to 
 * 						prompt the user for the deck size and the number of players. Hands will then be generated for each player,
 * 						printed to the console, and evaluated. The evaluation will print to the console.
 * Performance Issues:	(1) Error handling is not done for the user input.
 * 						(2) The DeckOutOfCardsException caught by the main class will only be caught once. If another error of this type occurs, program crashes.
 * 						(3) The statistics for the hand probability do not seem to match up. There has been no quantitative analysis as of yet, however.
 * Assignment:          Lab 2
